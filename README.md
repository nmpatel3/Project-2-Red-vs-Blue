As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 

As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs. I also used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report. Then, interpreted our log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that we successfully performed.
